# RobotResearcher

This is the research tool built for and used in the thesis [*The Broken Windows Theory in Software Engineering: An experiment on technical debt propagation*](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4812956) conducted by [Hampus Broman](https://github.com/HBroman) and [William Lev√©n](https://github.com/williamleven) in 2021.

Check out the [demo](https://bwtse.github.io/RobotResearcher/index.html)!

Read the thesis for more information about how the tool was used.

## Notes

If you have any questions or feel that anything is amiss, please [open an issue](https://github.com/BWTSE/RobotResearcher/issues).

1. The code is a mess as it evolved from a proof of concept and never was intended to be used outside the short-lived scope of our thesis.
